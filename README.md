Scripts to allow for better productivity. Simplifies setting do not disturb in slack with a status message.

## Slack token
1. Get a slack-token (These are now called legacy tokens)
2. Add your slack token to the [slack-token](slack-token) file

## Configure
Configurable message, emoji and do not disturb time.

## Mac
Scripts for the brilliant [Focus-app](https://heyfocus.com/) are located in the [Focusapp-folder](focusapp/)(unfortunately macOS only). A slack-token is needed to use these scripts. You can read about how to generate one [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/215770388-Create-and-regenerate-API-tokens). This is a super-simple implementation, but the basics should work.

## Linux (Ubuntu)
The scripts are located in the [Linux-folder](linux/)

Install the dependencies
`sudo apt-get install at`

Enjoy!
